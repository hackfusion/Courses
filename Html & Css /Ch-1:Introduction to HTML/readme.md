# Chapter 1: Introduction to HTML

In this chapter, we will introduce you to the basics of HTML (HyperText Markup Language). HTML is the standard markup language used to structure the content of web pages. By the end of this chapter, you will have a solid understanding of HTML's syntax, fundamental elements, and their usage.

## What is HTML? üåê

HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is the backbone of every web page on the internet. HTML uses markup tags to define the structure and layout of a webpage. These tags enclose different types of content and provide instructions to web browsers on how to display that content.

## HTML Document Structure üìÑ

An HTML document consists of several elements that work together to create a web page. Let's explore the basic structure of an HTML document:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>My First Web Page</title>
</head>
<body>
    <!-- Content goes here -->
</body>
</html>
```

- The `<!DOCTYPE html>` declaration at the beginning specifies the HTML version being used, which is HTML5 in this case.
- The `<html>` element is the root element and encapsulates the entire HTML content.
- Inside the `<html>` element, we have two main sections: the `<head>` and the `<body>`.
- The `<head>` section contains meta-information about the document, such as the page title, linking to external stylesheets, or including JavaScript files.
- The `<body>` section contains the visible content of the webpage, including text, images, links, and other elements.

## HTML Tags and Elements üè∑Ô∏è

HTML tags are used to define the structure and appearance of the content within a webpage. Here are some commonly used HTML tags:

- `<h1>` to `<h6>`: Heading tags used to define different levels of headings.
- `<p>`: Paragraph tag used to enclose paragraphs of text.
- `<a>`: Anchor tag used to create hyperlinks to other web pages.
- `<img>`: Image tag used to display images on the webpage.
- `<ul>` and `<li>`: Unordered list and list item tags used to create bulleted lists.
- `<ol>` and `<li>`: Ordered list and list item tags used to create numbered lists.
- `<div>`: Division tag used to group elements and apply styles.
- `<span>`: Span tag used to apply styles to inline elements.

## Basic HTML Example ‚ú®

Let's create a simple HTML page to understand how these tags work together:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>My First Web Page</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Welcome to My Web Page</h1>
    <p>This is a paragraph of text.</p>
    <a href="https://www.example.com">Visit Example Website</a>
    <img src="image.jpg" alt="Image description">
</body>
</html>
```
![image]()
In the above example:
- We have a heading `<h1>` that displays the text "Welcome to My Web Page."
- The paragraph `<p>` contains some sample text.
- The anchor tag `<a>` creates a link with the anchor text "Visit Example Website" and links to `https://www.example.com`.
- The image tag `<img>` displays an image with a source (src) and alternative text (alt).
